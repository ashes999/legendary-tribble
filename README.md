# Legendary Tribble

A console-based cross between a MUD and a roguelike. Descend stairs, fight monsters, grab loot, and capture the `legendary tribble` from the bottom of the dungeon. Procedural generation guarantees each foray back into the dungeon provides a different experience.

To play, run `python play.py`. Built and tested with Python 2.7
